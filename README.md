# Zava Starter theme

Blank Wordpress starter theme built on Underscores with Mmenu app-like menu integrated for small screens.

The objective of this theme is to provide a blank, extremely fast loading parent & child theme to give developers a head start when developing custom Wordpress themes for their projects. We use it at https://zava.design for most of our client projects.

The parent theme is all Underscores, and can be updated at anytime simply by downloading the current theme from the Underscores website, and copying into the parent theme folder ("zava-starter").

The child theme is set up with minimal styles and functions to get every developer off to a fast start, and with the following frequently used features built in:
- MMenu app-like off canvas menu for small screens.
- Very basic, commonly used but easily removed two column layout.
- Two commonly used CSS grid layouts included, 3 column and 4 column.

Any of these features can be removed in seconds by deleting a few lines of code.

## How to use

To use for your own projects:
1. Download parent & child theme, and copy into your Wordpress project "themes" folder.
2. Rename "zava-starter" parent theme folder to name of your choice (your studio/business name?)
3. Rename "zava-child" child theme folder to name of your choice (your client's business name?)
4. In the child theme folder, open "style.css" and change "zava-starter" on line 6 to your renamed parent theme folder name.
5. You're now ready to begin customising the child theme for your project!
