# Zava Starter theme

Blank Wordpress starter theme built on Underscores with Mmenu app-like menu integrated for small screens.

The objective of this theme is to provde a blank, extremely fast loading parent & child theme to give developers a head start when develooing custom Wordpress themes for their clients.

The parent theme is all Underscores, and can be updated at anytime simply by downloading the current theme from the Underscores website, and copying into the parent theme folder ("zava-starter").

The child theme is set up with minimal styles and functions to get every developer off to a fast start, and with the following frequently used features built in:
- MMenu app-like off canvas menu for small screens.
- Very basic, commonly used but easily removed two column layout.
- Two commonly used CSS grid layouts included, 3 column and 4 column.
